# Pre-Trial

Once a suspect is **arrested or voluntarily appears** before the ICC, the case enters the **Pre-Trial phase**, overseen by a **Pre-Trial Chamber** composed of three judges. The purpose of this phase is to determine whether the case is strong enough to proceed to trial.

---

### Key Objectives

- **Verify the Suspectâ€™s Identity & Rights**  
  Confirm that the individual brought before the Court is the correct suspect and that their procedural rights have been respected throughout the process.

- **Confirmation of Charges**  
  The **Prosecutor** presents evidence to demonstrate **substantial grounds to believe** the suspect committed the alleged crimes. This is a higher threshold than the preliminary examination but lower than "beyond reasonable doubt."

- **Legal Challenges**  
  The **Defense** may challenge:
  - **The charges themselves**
  - **The admissibility** (e.g. national proceedings underway)
  - **The jurisdiction** of the ICC (e.g. location or nationality of crime)

---

### Judicial Deliberation

After reviewing all submissions:
- Each **judge independently drafts a ruling** (to confirm, decline, or amend the charges).
- The chamber works toward a **majority decision**. A **minority opinion** may be issued if unanimous agreement is not reached.
- Only **admissible evidence** is considered when making these determinations.

---

### Roles in the Simulation

- **Pre-Trial Judge 1**  
  Drafts an independent ruling and collaborates on forming the chamber's majority (or minority) opinion.

- **Pre-Trial Judge 2**  
  Same as above; brings individual interpretation to the case before working with peers.

- **Pre-Trial Judge 3**  
  Same as above; part of deliberative process toward final decision.

- **ICC Prosecutor 1**  
  Presents the formal **charges** and outlines the factual basis.

- **ICC Prosecutor 2**  
  Responds to **challenges** regarding **admissibility** and **jurisdiction**.

- **Defense Lawyer 1**  
  Disputes the **charges** and questions the sufficiency of the evidence.

- **Defense Lawyer 2**  
  Argues that the case is **inadmissible** or that the ICC lacks **jurisdiction**.
