# Pre-Trial

After a suspect is arrested or voluntarily surrenders to the ICC, a Pre-Trial Chamber of three judges conducts hearings to assess whether the case should proceed to trial. The main objectives of this phase are to:
Verify the suspects identity and ensure their rights have been respected
Confirm the charges - The prosecutor presents the evidence to show substantial grounds to believe the suspect committed the crime
Challenges - The defense should contest the charges, the admissibility, and the jurisdiction

After hearing the arguments, the judges should each independently create a ruling (whether to confirm, decline, or amend the charges) on the basis on admissable evidence.

Roles:
    Pre-Trial Judge 1 - Independently create a ruling, then work with other judges to create a majority (and possibly minority decision)
    Pre-Trial Judge 2 - Independently create a ruling, then work with other judges to create a majority (and possibly minority decision)
    Pre-Trial Judge 3 - Independently create a ruling, then work with other judges to create a majority (and possibly minority decision)
    ICC Prosecutor 1 - Presents the charges against the suspect
    ICC Prosecutor 2 - Contests arguments against the admissibility and the jurisdiction of the ICC
    Defense Lawyer 1 - Contests the charges against the suspect
    Defense Lawyer 2 - Presents arguments against the admissibility and the jurisdiction of the ICC
