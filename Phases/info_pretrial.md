# Pre-Trial

!![Header Visual](assets/images/icc.jpeg)

Once a suspect is **arrested or voluntarily appears** before the ICC, the case enters the **Pre-Trial phase**, overseen by a **Pre-Trial Chamber** of three judges. This phase determines whether the case has enough evidence and legal basis to proceed to trial.

### Pre-Trial Procedures

The **Pre-Trial Chamber** conducts several key steps to ensure the case is procedurally correct and justified:

- **Identity and Rights Verification**  
  Judges confirm the suspect’s identity and verify that arrest and detention procedures respected the suspect’s rights under international law.

- **Confirmation of Charges Hearing**  
  The **Prosecution** presents evidence showing there are **substantial grounds to believe** the suspect committed the alleged crimes. This is a higher threshold than the preliminary examination.

- **Defense Challenges**  
  The **Defense** may raise challenges related to:
  - The legal basis for the charges
  - The **admissibility** of the case (e.g. due to national proceedings)
  - The **jurisdiction** of the ICC (territorial or personal)

### Decision-Making by Judges

Following the hearings:
- Each judge independently drafts a legal opinion.
- A **majority decision** is issued to confirm, decline, or modify the charges.
- A **minority opinion** may be recorded, offering a dissenting view.
- Only evidence deemed **admissible** under ICC standards is considered.

If the charges are confirmed, the case proceeds to the **Trial phase**. If not, the case may be dismissed or returned for further investigation.

### Roles in the Simulation

- **Pre-Trial Judge 1, 2, & 3**  
  Each judge assesses the case independently and contributes to the final majority (or minority) ruling.

- **ICC Prosecutor 1**  
  Presents the charges and provides supporting evidence.

- **ICC Prosecutor 2**  
  Responds to defense objections related to admissibility and jurisdiction.

- **Defense Lawyer 1**  
  Challenges the factual basis and credibility of the charges.

- **Defense Lawyer 2**  
  Argues the case should be dismissed due to admissibility or jurisdictional issues.
