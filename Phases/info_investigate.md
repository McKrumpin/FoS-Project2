# Investigation

To begin ICC cases require a referral from one of three parties: 
UN Security Council Referral - A UN Security Council referral requires the UN Security Council to hold a successful vote to grant jurisdiction to the ICC. This is often beneficial in cases where ...MORE HERE...
State-Party Referral - A State-Party referral occurs when one or more states that has ratified the Rome Statute requests for an ICC investigation into a topic they believe will pass a preliminary examination. There is an uncommon form of a State-Party referral where a non-member state can refer itself and relinquish jurisdiction to the ICC.
Prosecutor’s Proprio Motu Initiative - A Prosecutor's Proprio Motu Iniative is where an ICC Prosecutor believe a case is of sufficient gravity to where the ICC should iniate a case on its own. This method of referral requires more approval from a panel of 3 pre-trial judges than the other methods.

Once the referral has been received, the Office of the prosecutor performs a preliminary examination. The preliminary examination includes:
Jurisdiction Analysis - A core part of the preliminary examination is ensuring that the ICC has jurisdictional authority over the case. The ICC jurisdiction requires the criminal acts to have occured in the territory of a member state, or be committed by a member state. A recommendation from the UN Security Council automatically satisfies the ICC's jurisdictional requirement.
Admissibility Check - The ICC only provides rulings on cases of crimes against humanity, genocide, and acts of aggression. 
Interests of Justice - The ICC must also analyze whether their involvement in a case would be beneficial to the victims of the accused. 

If the preliminary evaluation finds these three metrics sufficient the ICC opens a case and begins their investigation with the goal of collecting evidence, identifying suspects and potential charges, and requesting arrest warrants.
