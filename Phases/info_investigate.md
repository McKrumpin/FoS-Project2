# Investigation

To begin ICC cases require a referral from one of three parties: 
UN Security Council Referral
State-Party Referral
Prosecutor’s Proprio Motu Initiative 

Once the referral has been received, the Office of the prosecutor performs a preliminary examination. The preliminary examination includes:
Jurisdiction Analysis
Admissibility Check
Interests of Justice

If sufficient the ICC opens a case and begins their investigation with the goal of collecting evidence, identifying suspects and potential charges, and requesting arrest warrants.

    ICC Prosecutor 1 (Jurisdiction analysis)
    ICC Prosecutor 2 (Admissibility Check)
    ICC Prosecutor 3 (Interests of Justice)
    ICC Pre-Trial Judge (for Prosecutor’s Proprio Motu Initiative and issuance of arrest warrants)
