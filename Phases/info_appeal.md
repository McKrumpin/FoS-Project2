# Appeals

After a **trial verdict**, either the **Prosecution** or **Defense** may submit an **appeal** to challenge the decision. Appeals are reviewed by the **Appeals Chamber**, which is composed of **five judges**.

---

### Grounds for Appeal

- **Procedural Errors**  
  Examples: violations of fair trial rights, improper handling of the trial process, or judicial misconduct.

- **Legal Errors**  
  Examples: misapplication or misinterpretation of international criminal law or procedural rules.

- **Evidentiary Issues**  
  Examples: wrongful admission or exclusion of evidence that significantly impacted the verdict.

---

### Appeals Process

- The Appeals Chamber **does not call new witnesses** but thoroughly reviews the **trial record** and the arguments submitted.
- Judges may reconsider:
  - **Factual conclusions** (if clearly unreasonable)
  - **Legal interpretations** and procedural decisions

### Possible Outcomes

- **Uphold** the original verdict and sentence  
- **Reverse** the verdict (e.g., change a conviction to an acquittal)  
- **Amend** the judgment (e.g., reduce the sentence, modify charges)  
- **Order a retrial** if serious flaws undermined the fairness of the original trial
