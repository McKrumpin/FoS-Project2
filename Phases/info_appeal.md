# Appeals

Following the trial verdict, either the Prosecution or Defense may file an appeal based on:
Procedural errors (eg violation of fair trial rights)
Legal errors (eg misapplication of legal standards)
Evidentiary issues (eg wrongful admission or exclusion of evidence)

The Appeals Chamber, composed of five judges, reviews the claims and trial record. They do not reevaluate witnesses but may reconsider legal and factual conclusions. The chamber can:
Uphold the original verdict and sentence
Reverse the verdict (eg acquittal instead of conviction)
Amend the judgment (eg reduce sentence, change charges)
Order a retrial if the trial was fundamentally flawed
