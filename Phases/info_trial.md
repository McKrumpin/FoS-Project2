# Trial

!![Header Visual](assets/images/icc.jpeg)

Once the **Pre-Trial Chamber confirms the charges**, the case advances to the **Trial phase**, overseen by a new **Trial Chamber** of three judges. This is the central stage of the ICC process where the Court determines the **guilt or innocence** of the accused.

### Trial Proceedings

The trial is structured to ensure a fair and transparent examination of all relevant facts. It includes the following stages:

- **Opening Statements**  
  The **Prosecution** and **Defense** deliver opening remarks outlining their respective cases, strategies, and major arguments.

- **Presentation of Evidence**  
  - Examination of **witnesses**, including victims and experts  
  - Introduction of **documentary**, **forensic**, or **digital** materials  
  - Opportunity for **cross-examination** and raising **legal objections**

- **Closing Statements**  
  Each side summarizes their position, highlighting the most persuasive evidence and undermining the other side’s case.

### Judicial Deliberation

Following the presentation of all evidence:
- Each **judge drafts an independent opinion** on the facts and legal findings.
- A **majority decision** is issued determining guilt or innocence.
- A **minority opinion** may be written if one judge disagrees.
- If found **guilty**, the chamber proceeds to issue a **sentence**, which may include imprisonment, reparations, or fines.
