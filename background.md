# üåç Simulation Background

This simulation places you in the shoes of individuals who participate in the workings of the **International Criminal Court (ICC)**. Through structured phases ‚Äî Investigation, Pre-Trial, Trial, and Appeals ‚Äî you will experience the legal and ethical complexities of global justice.

---

## üß≠ Purpose of the Simulation

The goal of this exercise is to give you an applied understanding of:
- How the ICC investigates and prosecutes international crimes
- The different roles and procedures involved in international criminal justice
- Legal concepts such as jurisdiction, admissibility, complementarity, and the interests of justice
- Evidence evaluation and courtroom deliberation

You‚Äôll not only practice legal reasoning and teamwork but also grapple with real-world ethical dilemmas and decision-making under uncertainty.

## ‚öñÔ∏è What is the ICC?

The **International Criminal Court** is a permanent international tribunal established in 2002 by the Rome Statute. It has the authority to prosecute individuals for the gravest crimes of concern to the international community:
- **Genocide**
- **Crimes against humanity**
- **War crimes**
- **Crime of aggression**

Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which handles disputes between states, the ICC deals with **individual criminal responsibility**.
