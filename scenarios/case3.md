### Charges:
13 counts of war crimes and 5 counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, sexual slavery, persecution, forcible transfer of population, and the conscription and use of child soldiers. Crimes were allegedly committed in 2002–2003 in Ituri, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Background:
Bosco Ntaganda, former Deputy Chief of Staff and commander of operations of the Forces Patriotiques pour la Libération du Congo (FPLC), was the subject of two ICC arrest warrants issued in 2006 and 2012. He surrendered voluntarily in 2013. The crimes charged arose from ethnic conflict in the Ituri region, where Ntaganda allegedly directed FPLC military operations against civilians.

### Trial Chamber Conviction:
On 8 July 2019, Trial Chamber VI found Ntaganda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment on 7 November 2019. His time in ICC detention (since March 2013) was credited against the sentence.

### Appeals Chamber Ruling:
On 30 March 2021, the ICC Appeals Chamber confirmed both the conviction and sentence. Reparations proceedings were initiated and remain ongoing. As of March 2025, the Court endorsed the eligibility of 1,549 victims for reparations, including priority for 12 particularly vulnerable individuals.

### Significance:
The Ntaganda case is a milestone in international criminal justice, marking one of the ICC's most comprehensive convictions for crimes involving child soldiers and sexual violence. It also represents an evolving commitment to victim reparations, with the Court actively reviewing and updating implementation procedures amid ongoing regional instability.
